# Gradio Website

Landing page for a cosmetics company, designed by [Nadir B.](https://behance.net/nadir9020)

## What I learned from the process

- How to install and configure node packages with NPM.
- TailwindCSS, that's the reason why I picked up this project, to familiarize myself with the framework.
- How to use PostCSS with autoprefixer and Tailwind as plugins.
- How to set up the website for production, purging unused styles and minifying what's left.
